# Corner-Detection

Various corners are detected ,using the techniques given by Harris and Shi Tomashi(GoodFeaturesToTrack) seperately.Although there are some unnecessary corners detected at places like the top of chess pieces but apart from that we can observe the corners of the chessboards are detected with a good accuracy.

The corners are more accurately detected by the 'goodfeaturestotrack' technique by Mr.Shi Tomashi in one of his research papers.
